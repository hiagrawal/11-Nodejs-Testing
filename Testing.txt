We will be using Mocha, Chai for Testing
Docs: 
https://mochajs.org/

install in application:
npm install --save-dev mocha chai

to run test, add command in package.json file
There we see 'test' command in scripts, give it value 'mocha'

and now run in terminal type 'npm test'. It will run all the test cases written

To write test case, Mocha looks for folder named 'test'. It has to be test only and inside this, we can create javascript files 
of any name

Now Mocha is responsible for running our tests and giving us 'it' function, 
chai is responsible for defining our success conditions that is expect funtion we get from chai

describe() is used to group test cases and we can have multiple describe nested in one another
