We will be using Mocha, Chai for Testing
Docs: 
https://mochajs.org/
https://www.chaijs.com/
https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/

install in application:
npm install --save-dev mocha chai

to run test, add command in package.json file
There we see 'test' command in scripts, give it value 'mocha'

and now run in terminal type 'npm test'. It will run all the test cases written

To write test case, Mocha looks for folder named 'test'. It has to be test only and inside this, we can create javascript files 
of any name

Now Mocha is responsible for running our tests and giving us 'it' function, 
chai is responsible for defining our success conditions that is expect funtion we get from chai

describe() is used to group test cases and we can have multiple describe nested in one another

What not to test:
We should not test any third party/ external packages methods or functions. They provide us the methods and they do it on their own
we just have to test our functionality, our logic

so in auth middleware, we are not supposed to test jwt verify method as it is jwt method and logic
what we should test is.. if verify method returns success or failure and if our code works correctly
that if decodedToken is not there then it should throw error and if it is there then it should have userid
